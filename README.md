## Development

To run the software application use 
node src/BookShopApp.js 'name of book 1' 'name of book 2'...

On start the application prints 3 examples of how the app works and checks if they are correct. Then will print out the price before and after discount of the books provided as arguments. # Gamesys-Technical-Task
